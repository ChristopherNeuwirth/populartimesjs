PopulartimesJs is a javascript based library to retrieve the popular times of a Google Place, its current popularity and if you provide a Google Developer API key, place meta data such as location, name and many more. All you need to provide is a Google Place id. This library is based on the idea of [m-wrzr populartimes library](https://github.com/m-wrzr/populartimes).
